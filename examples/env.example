## The directory where air flights, or CO2 emissions for a given air flight
## requested to GO Climate are stored after it has been requested.
## The main purpose if to prevent co2eq to resolve the same request multiple time
CACHE_DIR = "./cache"

## co2eq retrieves flight offers to estimate a real flight and uses the AMADEUS API:
## https://developers.amadeus.com/get-started/get-started-with-amadeus-apis-334
## You need to register and request and an API Key and an API Secret for the
## Flight Offers Search service.
AMADEUS_ID = 'XXXXXXX'
AMADEUS_SECRET = 'XXXXXXXXXX'

## To compute the CO2 emissions associated a flight a request is sent to GO Climate
## Please go through https://api.goclimate.com/docs to get an account.
GOCLIMATE_SECRET =  'XXXXXXXXXX'
NOMINATIM_ID = "ietf" 

## where logs are stored. We suggest you perform tail -f your_log_file
## to monitor what can possibly go wrong.
log = './co2eq.log'

## Directory where all outputs are stored
#OUTPUT_DIR=/app/src/co2eq/output                            #For docker images
#OUTPUT_DIR=/home/your_path_to_project_folder/output         #For local development
OUTPUT_DIR = "/home/emigdan/gitlab/ietf/co2eq/examples/output"

## in this case this is the directory of the jekyl web server.
#  'OUTPUT_DIR' : "/home/emigdan/gitlab/ietf/article-co2eq/www/co2eq/IETF", 
#  'OUTPUT_DIR' : "/home/emigdan/gitlab/ietf/article-co2eq/www/co2eq/ICANN",

## CityDB specific parameters
## ISO3166_REPRESENTATIVE_CITY enable to indicate a specific
## representative city for that country.
## This is usually useful when the capital is not the main 
## representative city or when no flight can be retrieved from 
## that country. Typically, the free account from amadeux only provides 
## sub set of the flights
ISO3166_REPRESENTATIVE_CITY = './conf_rep_cities.json'
